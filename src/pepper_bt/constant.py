Rubens painted a commissioned work depicting the story of Sisamnes, a corrupt judge in the

the moment when Cambyses, depicted in a dynamic pose, appointed Sisamnes' son, Otanes, as the new judge, 
placing his father's flayed skin as a canopy over the judge's seat as a reminder of the consequences of corruption.
